Algorithm: Create JSON and Write to File

1. Import the necessary libraries, including 'org.json.simple.JSONObject'.

2. Create a main method to perform the following tasks:
   - Create a JSONObject instance named jo.
   - Add a key-value pair to jo where key "a" maps to the value 1.
   - Create a LinkedHashMap named m to store nested key-value pairs.
   - Add key-value pairs to m where key "c" maps to the value 2 and key "d" maps to the value 3.
   - Add the m map as a value to jo with the key "b".
   
3. Create a PrintWriter instance named 'pw' to write data to a file named "JSONExample.json".

4. Use the 'toJSONString' method of 'jo' to convert the JSON object to a JSON string.

5. Write the JSON string to the file using pw.write().

6. Flush the PrintWriter to ensure that all data is written.

7. Close the PrintWriter to release resources.
